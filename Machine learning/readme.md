# Comprehensive Data Report: Anomaly Prediction Model

## Dataset Analysis:

### 1.1 Nature of the Data:
The dataset provided for the project addresses the classification of abnormal data registered from different patients. It includes six features for each patient: incidence, tilt, angle, slope, radius, and grade. The task is to classify samples as normal or abnormal, where anomalous samples correspond to patients with various medical problems (e.g., disk hernia, spondylolisthesis).

### 1.2 Data Structure and Characteristics:
Features:
* Incidence
* Tilt
* Angle
* Slope
* Radius
* Grade

Target Variable:
* Binary classification: Normal (0) or Abnormal (1)

## 2 Statistical Analysis:

### 2.1 Descriptive Statistics:
Performed basic descriptive statistics, including mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for each feature. This helped in understanding the central tendency and variability in the data.

### 2.2 Advanced Statistical Methods:
Utilized advanced statistical methods such as correlation analysis to explore relationships between features and the target variable. Examined the distribution of each feature to identify potential outliers.

## 3. Machine Learning Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 3.1 Model Selection:
For the anomaly prediction task, we chose the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in handling classification problems. KNN is well-suited for anomaly detection, particularly when the decision boundary is non-linear and the dataset is not too large.

### 3.2 Dataset Balancing with SMOTE:
Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, where the number of abnormal instances is significantly lower than the normal instances, we employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE generates synthetic instances for the minority class, addressing the class imbalance and providing the model with a more representative training set.

### 3.3 Hyperparameter Tuning:
To optimize the performance of the KNN model, we conducted hyperparameter tuning. The key hyperparameter for KNN is the number of neighbors (n_neighbors). We utilized techniques such as grid search to find the optimal value for n_neighbors. The goal was to identify the configuration that maximizes the model's ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal instances.

### 3.4 Model Development:
Implemented the KNN model with the optimal hyperparameters and trained it on the dataset augmented with SMOTE-generated samples.

## 4. Model Evaluation:

### 4.1 Performance Metrics:
Evaluated the KNN model using a comprehensive set of performance metrics:

Accuracy: 0.8653846153846154
Precision: 0.8
Recall: 1.0
F1 Score: 0.888888888888889
ROC AUC Score: 0.8541666666666666

### 4.2 Significance of Metrics:
The use of SMOTE significantly improved the model's ability to recognize anomalies by addressing the class imbalance issue. The achieved recall of 1.0 indicates that the model successfully identified all abnormal instances, minimizing false negatives. Precision of 0.8 demonstrates a balanced trade-off between correctly identifying anomalies and avoiding false positives.

The F1 Score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a consolidated measure of the model's overall performance. The ROC AUC Score of 0.8541666666666666 further confirms the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between normal and abnormal instances.

In summary, the combination of the KNN model, SMOTE for dataset balancing, and hyperparameter tuning led to a well-performing anomaly detection model with robust metrics across accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

## 5. Results and Discussion:

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 86.5%, indicating its proficiency in correctly classifying both normal and abnormal instances.
Precision: 0.8

Precision of 0.8 highlights the model's capability to accurately identify abnormal instances while minimizing false positives, making it a reliable tool for medical anomaly detection.
Recall: 1.0

A perfect recall of 1.0 underscores the model's ability to identify all instances of abnormality. This is a crucial metric in the context of medical diagnosis, where missing an abnormal case is highly undesirable.
F1 Score: 0.888888888888889

The F1 Score, balancing precision and recall, attains a high value of approximately 0.89, indicating a harmonious trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
ROC AUC Score: 0.8541666666666666

The ROC AUC Score of 0.8541666666666666 reflects the model's robustness in distinguishing between normal and abnormal instances across different classification thresholds.

### 5.3 Implications and Insights:
The exceptional recall and F1 Score suggest that the KNN model, enriched by the inclusion of SMOTE, has successfully learned to identify anomalies, particularly instances associated with medical problems such as disk hernia and spondylolisthesis. The use of SMOTE played a pivotal role in mitigating the impact of class imbalance, leading to a more balanced and effective model.

### 5.4 Further Considerations:
While the model showcases impressive results, ongoing evaluation on new data and continuous monitoring are recommended. Additionally, collaboration with domain experts may provide further insights into the clinical relevance and interpretation of model predictions.

In conclusion, the results obtained from the KNN model, especially after incorporating SMOTE and fine-tuning hyperparameters, demonstrate a promising approach to anomaly detection in the medical domain. The model's high recall and precision underscore its potential utility in real-world scenarios for identifying patients with abnormal medical conditions.
